This repository is a fork from the official https://github.com/dh-electronics/meta-av96
repository.

The aim of this fork is to provide an integration of the Avenger96 board in
the OpenSTLinux build system taking into account Openembedded Yocto Thud
environement and adding the support of the ov5640 CSI camera.

The target is to merge all the patches provided by this fork into the official
meta-av96.

This repository will disapear once official meta-av96 layer will be up to
date.

This layer has been succesfully tested with OpenSTLinux v1.1.0 and the
Avenger96 board rev 588-200.
